# Tetris Battle
An old game made in 2012 inspired by similar online multiplayer tetris games.

### AI
The AI works by evaluating the board using a scoring function, looking two moves ahead. The AI has been slowed down to look more human, and to give the player a fighting chance.

### Attack Orbs
When removing 2 or more rows at the same time, an orb will appear on your board. Removing it from the board will grant you a power from the list:

| Name | Color | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add | red | Add 1 row |
| Remove | yellow | Remove 1 row |
| Earthquake | purple | Randomly shake up each row |
| Ladder | brown | Remove every other row |
| Copycat | pink | Completely copies a board |
| Erase | grey | Removes every block from board |
| Acid | multiple | Distracting visual effect that lasts multiple seconds |

### Video
